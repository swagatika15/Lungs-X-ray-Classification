# Lungs-X-ray-Classification
The aim of this project is to import image files from Google Drive, the images are chest X-rays. Each X-ray in the set is that of a patient with either pneumonia or a normal lung field. There are two types of infection: bacterial and viral. The aim is to predict if a previously unseen chest X-ray is normal or if it depicts either bacterial or viral pneumonia.
